Points to remember from security point of view:


##############################
while hitting a get request from a browser to obtain data, make sure that only authorised persons get to access the data
so use cookies(jwt) for checking if the person is admin or logged in or not (create a middleware to check )

##################################
For loggin function:

1. Check for empty parameters
2. Send request under try catch block with jwt token
3. Check check for response
4. If response is not empty then check if passwords are equal
5. Register a cookie (for checkin in future if the user has logged in)
